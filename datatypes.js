Data Types

In JavaScript, data types can be broadly categorized into two types: primitive data types and reference data types. Understanding these distinctions is fundamental to mastering JavaScript.

### Primitive Data Types

Primitive data types are the most basic kinds of data. They are immutable, meaning that their value cannot be changed once assigned. JavaScript has seven primitive data types:

1. **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers.
   ```javascript
   let age = 25;
   let pi = 3.14;
   ```

2. **String**: Represents sequences of characters.
   ```javascript
   let name = "John";
   ```

3. **Boolean**: Represents logical values, either `true` or `false`.
   ```javascript
   let isStudent = true;
   ```

4. **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
   ```javascript
   let notAssigned;
   console.log(notAssigned);  // undefined
   ```

5. **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   ```javascript
   let emptyValue = null;
   ```

6. **Symbol**: Represents a unique and immutable value often used as object keys.
   ```javascript
   let symbol1 = Symbol('description');
   ```

7. **BigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision.
   ```javascript
   let bigIntValue = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n);
   ```

### Reference Data Types

Reference data types are more complex. They can hold multiple values and are mutable. When you create a reference type, you are actually creating a reference to a location in memory where the data is stored. JavaScript has primarily three reference data types:

1. **Object**: A collection of key-value pairs. Objects can store properties and methods.
   ```javascript
   let person = {
     name: "John",
     age: 25
   };
   ```

2. **Array**: A special type of object for storing ordered collections of values.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
   ```

3. **Function**: A block of code designed to perform a particular task.
   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     console.log("Hello!");
   }
   ```

### Key Differences Between Primitive and Reference Types

1. **Immutability vs. Mutability**:
   - **Primitive Types**: Immutable. Once a primitive value is assigned, it cannot be changed. Any operation on a primitive value results in a new value.
   - **Reference Types**: Mutable. You can change the contents of an object or array after it's created.

2. **Memory Allocation**:
   - **Primitive Types**: Stored directly in the location that the variable accesses. This means the actual value is stored in the variable.
   - **Reference Types**: Stored in heap memory. The variable stores a reference (memory address) to the actual object in the heap.

3. **Copying Behavior**:
   - **Primitive Types**: When you copy a primitive value, you copy the actual value.
     ```javascript
     let a = 10;
     let b = a;
     b = 20;
     console.log(a);  // 10 (unchanged)
     ```
   - **Reference Types**: When you copy a reference value, you copy the reference to the object, not the object itself. Both variables point to the same object.
     ```javascript
     let obj1 = { name: "John" };
     let obj2 = obj1;
     obj2.name = "Doe";
     console.log(obj1.name);  // "Doe" (changed)
     ```

### Conclusion

Primitive and reference data types in JavaScript are fundamental concepts that determine how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated. Primitive types are simple and immutable, while reference types are complex and mutable, with significant differences in memory allocation and behavior when copied or assigned. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.
